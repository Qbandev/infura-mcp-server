# Security Policy

## Release Security

This repository implements strict security controls for automated releases to prevent unauthorized publishing.

### üîí **Access Control**

Only the following users can trigger releases:

1. **Repository Owner**: `Qbandev` (automatically authorized)
2. **Authorized Collaborators**: Listed in the workflow configuration

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security Measures**

#### **1. Authorization Check**
- Every release workflow starts with an authorization verification
- Checks if the triggering user is the repository owner or in the authorized users list
- Fails immediately if unauthorized user attempts to trigger release

#### **2. User Verification**
- Compares `github.actor` (who triggered the workflow) against authorized list
- Logs all authorization attempts for audit trail
- Provides clear error messages for unauthorized attempts

#### **3. Workflow Dependencies** 
- Release job only runs after successful authorization
- Uses GitHub's `needs` and `if` conditions for enforcement
- Cannot be bypassed or skipped

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration**

#### **Adding Authorized Users**

To authorize additional users to trigger releases:

1. Edit `.github/workflows/release.yml`
2. Find the `AUTHORIZED_USERS` variable in the authorize job:
   ```bash
   AUTHORIZED_USERS="Qbandev additional_user another_user"
   ```
3. Add GitHub usernames separated by spaces
4. Commit and push the changes

#### **Security Best Practices**

- ‚úÖ Only add trusted collaborators who should have release privileges
- ‚úÖ Regularly review the authorized users list
- ‚úÖ Monitor GitHub Actions logs for unauthorized attempts
- ‚úÖ Use branch protection rules on `main` branch
- ‚úÖ Require signed commits (currently enforced)

### üö® **Incident Response**

If you suspect unauthorized release attempts:

1. Check GitHub Actions logs for failed authorization attempts
2. Review the commit history for unauthorized changes to the workflow
3. Rotate the `NPM_TOKEN` secret if compromised
4. Consider enabling GitHub's security alerts

### üìã **Security Audit Log**

The authorization check logs the following information:
- Repository owner
- Workflow actor (who triggered it)
- Authorized users list
- Authorization result (success/failure)
- Timestamp (via GitHub Actions)

### üîê **Additional Security Options**

For enhanced security, consider:

1. **Environment Protection** (manual setup in GitHub Settings):
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Environments
   - Create a `production` environment
   - Add required reviewers
   - Set deployment restrictions

2. **Branch Protection**:
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require status checks
   - Restrict pushes to main branch

3. **Repository Secrets**:
   - Regularly rotate `NPM_TOKEN`
   - Monitor secret usage in Actions logs
   - Use least-privilege principle

### üìû **Contact**

For security concerns or questions:
- Create a private GitHub issue
- Contact repository owner: `Qbandev`
